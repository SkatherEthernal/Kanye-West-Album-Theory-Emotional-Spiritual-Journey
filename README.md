# Kanye-West-Album-Theory-Emotional-Spiritual-Journey
This is a personal theory about Kanye West's albums. I believe they form a spiritual and emotional storyline that reflects different stages of Kanye's life—his experiences with fame, grief, redemption, and inner transformation. Each album tells a piece of this journey, like chapters in a deeply personal story. 
My Theory on Kanye West's Albums
This is my personal theory about Kanye West's albums. According to me, they form a deep emotional and spiritual storyline. Here's how I see it:

The College Trilogy (The College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation):
These albums represent Kanye's early life and the journey through his education and into fame. 'The College Dropout' reflects him leaving college to pursue music. 'Late Registration' continues his rise, and 'Graduation' represents a sense of achievement, with songs like “Good Morning”, “The Glory”, and “Good Life” symbolizing how proud he made his mother, Donda. “Good Night” feels like a farewell to his past, perhaps to Donda too, before entering a darker phase.

808s & Heartbreak:
According to me, this is where Kanye falls into emotional pain after the death of his mother and a breakup. Songs like “Heartless” and “Coldest Winter” reflect this. “Welcome to Heartbreak” and “Bad News” further show his inner struggle. This album may be seen as the moment he lost direction, not getting the “Good Ass Job” he once aimed for.

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to The Life of Pablo:
These albums portray Kanye’s descent into chaos and sin. 'MBDTF' shows the height of fame but also his personal confusion. In 'The Life of Pablo', tracks like “I Love Kanye” show his struggle to find his identity again, and “Father Stretch My Hands” might be a cry to his parents for guidance. This period could be Kanye dreaming or lost in his own nightmare (as hinted in “See You in My Nightmare”), culminating in a desire to return to innocence and clarity.

Kids See Ghosts:
This feels like a dream world, perhaps heaven or a spiritual realm where Kanye reconnects with Donda (“Ghost”). He seeks rebirth (“Reborn”) and freedom (“Freeee”). This album is symbolic of reflection and wanting to become clean or good again.

Jesus Is King:
Kanye fully turns to God here. In “Selah”, he quotes the Bible, declaring freedom and seeking spiritual clarity. “Follow God” shows his internal conflict. This whole album marks a spiritual awakening and repentance.

Donda:
This album is Kanye grieving and trying to honor his mother. “Donda Chant” echoes her memory. “24” means he thinks of her every hour. “Come to Life” may represent his desire to see her again. It’s a vulnerable and emotional album full of mourning and spiritual seeking.

Vultures 1 & 2:
According to me, these show Kanye's fall again, but now with darker energy. In “CIRCLES”, he admits his flaws. 'Vultures' symbolize Kanye being reborn not into goodness, but into someone who embraces the chaos and pain. “MY SOUL”, “DEAD”, and “TIME MOVING SLOW” represent his reflection on Donda's death and the passage of time. 'Vultures 2' might take place during or after WW3—a world where Kanye wakes up to find everything ruined. He becomes a seed watered by harsh reality, growing into something more hardened and darker.

Overall:
I believe Kanye's albums follow a deep personal journey. From a hopeful start in the College Trilogy, to heartbreak, sin, redemption, grief, and spiritual battle. Whether it’s a dream, a metaphor, or reality, each album reveals a layer of his soul and life story.
