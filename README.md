# Kanye-West-Album-Theory-Emotional-Spiritual-Journey
This is a personal theory about Kanye West's albums. I believe they form a spiritual and emotional storyline that reflects different stages of Kanye's lifeâ€”his experiences with fame, grief, redemption, and inner transformation. Each album tells a piece of this journey, like chapters in a deeply personal story.
